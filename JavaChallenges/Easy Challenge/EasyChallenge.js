//EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.                                                       Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”

var person1 = 'Joe'
var person2 = 'Mike'

console.log(" Mike's name is longer than " + person1 + "'s" + " name by 1 character ")
